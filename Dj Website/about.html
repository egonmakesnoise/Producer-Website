            <p>For once, this is a case of scaling down, rather than up. <br>
                There is no need to over-play the hand; "Fixed Clouds" has been a prominent culture figure of the 2010s. <br>
                Few have been so successful in interrogating and furthering the intersection between electronic music,  <br>
                visual art, technology and science in the past ten years. As a DJ and live performer, <br>
                he has featured at nearly every major festival and club that one could list. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                An instalment in the BBC Essential Mix series; a Cercle livestream inside the Musee Bourdelle that reached hundreds of thousands of fans; <br>
                ‘Glassforms’, a reinterpretation of Philip Glass’ work; and even a collaboration with Zaha Hadid Architects, <br>
                mapping projections onto an 18th century castle, variously speak to his thrum of high-profile activity in recent years. <br>
                <hr>
                "Fixed Clouds" has an arms-length wingspan of achievement. <br>
                Yet the grand question that keeps his mind ticking as the 2020s begin is, in his own words, “a question of communication.”
